# Computer networks and distributed systems Email Server Simulation
This a repository containing the source code of an activity from the course "Computer Networks and Distributed Systems", where I implement a sort of Email Server. This project was implemented using Java 1.8 with the Netbeans IDE and Java Swing to generate the windows.

The file *src/util/Constants.java* contains the server IP and port configurations. The folder *src/view* contains the views implemented using Java Swing. The file *EmailServer.asta* contains the project class diagram (the rendered image is *EmailServerDiagram.png*).
